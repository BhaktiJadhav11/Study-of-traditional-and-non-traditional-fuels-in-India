# Study-of-traditional-and-non-traditional-fuels-in-India
##Introduction:
Buckle up for an engaging exploration into Analysis of Traditional and Non-traditional fuels, as we navigate through its various dimensions and implications.
we navigate the electrifying world of zero-emission vehicles and delve into the advancements shaping the automotive industry's green revolution.
From traditional fossil fuels to renewable alternatives, we delve into their impact on the environment, efficiency, and the future of energy.
Here,Traditional fuels like Petrol, Diesel and LPG and Non-Traditional fuels like CNG & electric Vehicles were taken under study.
Understanding the nuances of Petrol, Diesel and LPG is crucial in navigating the complex landscape of fuel choices, considering factors like energy efficiency.
Emissions and their respective roles in sustainable transportation. Data of 23 years 12 months was collected for Petrol, Diesel ,LPG, CNG and Electric Vehicles.
Outliers were replaced by mean _ median. Using R software  Time-series models were fitted. while fitting these models stationarity was removed by differencing and
various tests were also applied to know more information about data. After model fitting, count of all fuels in next five years were predicted.
we came to conclusion that it is not possible to replace Traditional Fuels by Non Traditional Fuels in next five years.
Correspondence Analysis was performed for all fuels and especially for Electric Vehicles for ten states. States were selected on the basis of highest number of RTO . 
After these analysis we came to conclusion that some states are needed to get more aware about Electric Vehicles.
